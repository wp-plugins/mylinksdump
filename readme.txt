== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any RSS feed for my link dump?

Yes there is. you can call myLinksDumpRSS.php file to show your link dump RSS feed. There is
also an option to replace your feedburner address rather than http://yoursite/myLinksDumpRSS.php .

= How can i customize the look of my link dump?

By default there are some predefined styles in myLinksDump/styles folder in which you set the
one you like the most. You can also put your stylesheet in  myLinksDump/styles folder and then
activate it through admin panel.

= How can i find page ID?

Click on Pages-> Edit link on wp admin area. Then click on the desired link and
wait for the next page to load. after this watch your browser address bar for 
destination link it shows. It must be something like this:

http://www.xyz.com/wp-admin/page.php?action=edit&post=14

the last number in query string (14) is what we need.

= What are the right places for putting `<?php echo myLinksDump_show() ;?>` and `<?php myLinksDump_Archive() ;?>`?

- `<?php echo myLinksDump_show() ;?>` must be out of content loop. Because if you put it in content loop,
you'll see lots of link dumps as much as your post entries.

- `<?php myLinksDump_Archive() ;?>` must be in content area. usually the best place to put this code is
right after `<?php the_content(); ?>` line in page.php of your theme.

= How can i share my links with others?

Thanks to myLinksDump RSS output you can share your links with others. It's good idea to write some lines in 
about Archive page on how others can grab your links dump RSS output and use that in their blogs or sites.
Normal RSS address of your links dump is '<yoursiteurl>/myLDRSS.php' (e.g: http://www.xyz.com/myLDRSS.php),
but if you prefer you can burn this feed in feedburner and provide feedburner address instead.
